Study group meetings &amp; agendas will be posted in this repo!   
  
   
## About our study group  
  
We are study group formed by members of [R-Ladies Chicago](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-chicago). By participating in this group, both in person and online, you agree to abide by the [R-Ladies Code of Conduct](https://rladies.org/code-of-conduct/).      
  
We aim to accomplish the following **objectives**:  
  
* To explore different aspects of text analysis in the R programming language.   
* To bring together like-minded individuals who are interested in text analysis.  
* To create a collaborative and friendly learning environment for individuals of all experience levels.    
  
  
## Upcoming Meetings  
  
The NLP study group will meet on a monthly basis (either the second Monday or Tuesday of each month, with a few exceptions).  
  
During our meetings, we'll be going through [Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) in 1-2 chapter increments.  
  
Meetings are currently scheduled for the following dates:  
  
* Monday, June 4th (virtual planning meeting, see [meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1531CUb2xZ1XQsNsYPBOCnlCAKBJkyxXdqyO_TFdDP14/edit?usp=sharing))
* Tuesday, June 26th (6:30-8pm) 
* Monday, July 9th  
* Monday, August 13th  
* Monday, September 17th  
  
All sessions will take place from 5:45pm to 7:30pm unless otherwise noted. These dates are subject to change. More dates will be added as they become available.  
  
  
## Meeting format  
  
~1 week before the meeting, we will assign a chapter (or two) of *Text Mining with R* for attendees to read/skim to read before our meeting.  
  
General meeting structure (still a work in progress!):  
  
1. ~5 minute lightning talk on a package, function, or other resource useful for text mining/NLP in R  
2. Any action items from the previous meeting (i.e. someone presents an application of a technique discussed at the last meeting)  
3. ~5 minute lightning summary about the assigned readings   
4. Discussion on questions anyone has about the readings  
5. Group works together on exercises related to techniques discussed in reading  
6. Determine action items for next meeting   
  
  
## We welcome your feedback!  
  
We are seeking volunteers to give a lightning talk or summary, or suggest a dataset to play with. We also welcome any feedback to make this study group more useful for the R-Ladies Chicago community.
